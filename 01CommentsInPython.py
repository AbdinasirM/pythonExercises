#print('hello')

#Comments
# Comments can be used to explain Python code.
#Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
#Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
#Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

#Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
#print('hello')
'''
print('hello')
print('hello')
print('hello')
'''
print('hello')

#Question: run this file but before you do that guess how many hello you would see and why.
